# Commands access system
The system is pretty simple: the higher level role has, the more commands its owner can access. This means that if role has level 3, its owner can use service, mod and music commands.
<p>Most commands in 'service' addon require at least level 3 or greater.</p>
<p>Commands in 'mod' addon require at least level 2 or greater.</p>
<p>Some music commands in 'voice' addon require at least level 1 or greater (to prevent abuse).</p>
<p>There are some commands in 'service' addon, which can be accessed only by owner or level 9000 or greater which can be considered as co-owner.</p>
